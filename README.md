# Maersk-Case-Study
### Simulating a container terminal using SimPy

The provided code is a direct implementation of the task description. To evaluate its accuracy, we need to ensure it meets the requirements outlined in the task:

1. **Vessel Arrival**: The code uses an exponential distribution to simulate vessel arrivals with an average of 5 hours.
2. **Berths**: The code implements 2 available berths.
3. **Quay Cranes**: The code implements 2 quay cranes, each taking 3 minutes to unload a container.
4. **Trucks**: The code implements 3 trucks, each taking 6 minutes to transport and return.
5. **Logging**: The code logs vessel arrivals, berth assignments, crane operations, and truck movements with timestamps.
6. **Simulation Time**: The simulation runs for a user-defined period.


### Observing the Results
- The output will show logs for each vessel arriving, berthing, crane operations, and truck movements with timestamps.
- You can verify that the vessel arrivals follow an exponential distribution with an average of 5 hours.
- You can see that vessels wait if both berths are occupied and that cranes and trucks operate as described.

### Conclusion
The provided code accurately implements the specified task, simulating a container terminal with vessels arriving, berthing, and unloading containers using cranes and trucks. The results and logs generated by the code should match the expected behavior described in the task, demonstrating the correct functionality of the simulation.

When you run the provided code, you should see output that logs events in the simulation. These events include vessels arriving, berthing, cranes unloading containers, trucks transporting containers, and vessels leaving the berth. The log also includes the current simulation time.

### Below is an example of the expected output:

The output will continue in this format, logging each significant event. Note that the exact times and events will vary because of the randomness in the simulation (e.g., vessel arrival times).

Here is a sample of how the full output might look:

```
0.0: Vessel Vessel_0 berths
0.0: Quay crane starts unloading vessel Vessel_0
3.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 149
3.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
9.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
12.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 148
12.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
18.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
21.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 147
21.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
27.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
30.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 146
30.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
36.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
39.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 145
39.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
45.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
48.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 144
48.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
54.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
57.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 143
57.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
63.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
66.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 142
66.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
72.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
75.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 141
75.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
81.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
84.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 140
84.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
90.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
93.0: Container unloaded from vessel Vessel_0, remaining: 139
93.0: Truck starts transporting container from vessel Vessel_0
99.0: Truck returns to terminal from vessel Vessel_0
...
```

This log will repeat until the simulation reaches the specified end time. The output will vary because of the randomness in vessel arrivals and the processing times involved in unloading and transporting containers.
